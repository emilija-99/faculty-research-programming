Welcome! This folder is a collection of C# code examples that cover various software design concepts and programming practices. It's part of my faculty research on software design, and I hope you'll find it useful for learning or brushing up on C#.

Important Note
Not all programs here are set up to run automatically in Visual Studio Code or other IDEs. Some of these are just snippets or practice exercises. You might need to make small changes, like adding namespaces or fixing methods, to get them running smoothly in your environment.

How to Use
Feel free to explore the code! Each example is meant to demonstrate a specific C# concept.
To try them out, copy the code into a new project in Visual Studio or VS Code. Adjust things like namespaces or using statements as needed.
Contributions Welcome
If you have suggestions or improvements, Iâ€™d love your input! Feel free to fork the repository and create a pull request.

Happy coding!
